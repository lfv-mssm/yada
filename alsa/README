ALSA software sound mixing on linux

This folder contains a fix that makes it possible to run the system 
under Linux without a soundcard that supports hardware mixing. This 
fix is needed due to a bug in the java sound routines that opens and 
allocates a hardware sound output device directly.
The solution is very simple:

1. Copy the file asoundrc to your home directory and rename it to .asoundrc.
   Requires alsa version 1.0.14 or later.
